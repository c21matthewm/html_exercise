    <h3>Cities I Would Like to Visit</h3>
        <p>
            My destinations are all based on the acivities I want to do there. I want to ski at 
            Crested Butte and near Salt Lake City, and then just explore the mountains and wilderness 
            in the area that has survived the seemingly never-ending urban creep.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <strong><li><span class="city">Crested Butte</span> - cute little mountain town and has excellent 
            skiing</li></strong>
            <em><li><span class="city">Salt Lake City</span> - many ski resorts I have not tried 
            yet</li></em>
            <strong><li><span class="city">Missoula</span> - growing town with lots of outdoor acitivies, 
            but has not yet become overcrowded</li></strong>
        </ol>
